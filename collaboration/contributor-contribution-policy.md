# TapLive Collaborator Contribution Policy

## 1. Open Collaboration (Open Participation without Barriers)
TapLive follows the spirit of open collaboration and open source, welcoming any developers to participate in platform functionality design and implementation based on public documents, community tasks, or proposal mechanisms. No prior permission or qualification is required, and no entry barriers are set.

## 2. Clear Attribution and Ownership
All modules independently developed or led by collaborators will have their contributor identities clearly indicated in documentation, interface definitions, and update logs. Contributors retain original attribution and optional licensing rights for usage.

## 3. No Commission or Forced Custody of Contributor’s Earnings or Rights
The platform does not take a commission from developers' contributions or control the original code. The calling rights, open strategies, and business models for all functional modules and tool interfaces are decided by the original authors, with the platform providing collaboration mechanisms and transparent record support.

## 4. Autonomy over Publication and Maintenance of Collaborator-Led Modules
Collaborators can decide whether to open, merge, or integrate their maintained modules into the main codebase or enable their functions within the main platform. The platform does not enforce integration or change developers' design intentions.

## 5. Contribution Reputation System (TapLive Credits)
TapLive Credits, a non-financial internal collaboration recognition tool, only records developers' contribution history, feedback positivity, and collaboration credibility. Credits are non-tradable, non-transferable, and cannot be exchanged for cash or goods.
In the future, if the platform generates income, the community may explore reasonable reward mechanisms based on collaboration records. All incentive mechanisms must be determined through the governance process, with the platform offering data and advisory support.

## 6. Safe Integration and Usage Control Support
The platform helps developers set usage restrictions for interfaces (e.g., call frequency, authorization verification, access whitelist), providing basic documentation templates, anti-abuse mechanisms, and misuse alert interfaces to prevent malicious calls or improper use of interfaces.

## 7. Risk Disclaimer and Platform Support
TapLive ensures the stability of the platform’s operation (e.g., servers, interface scheduling) but will not bear legal responsibility for the consequences of developer-led modules being used by third parties. The platform will assist collaborators in writing usage instructions, setting call restrictions, and providing basic legal disclaimers and community review suggestions.

## 8. Project Risk and Contribution Disclaimer
TapLive is an experimental collaborative project, and we cannot guarantee commercial success or reaching any expected income goals. If the project does not scale or generate income in the future, all contributions made by developers are voluntary collaborations and do not constitute investment or income promises. The platform also does not assume any return obligations.
If the platform generates income in the future, the community may explore reasonable reward mechanisms based on collaboration records. All incentive mechanisms must be determined through the governance process, with the platform offering data and advisory support.

This policy is for the current stage of developer rights and will continue to be optimized through the community proposal process.
