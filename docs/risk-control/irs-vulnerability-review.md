# 🚨 IRS Risk Control Model — Vulnerability & Improvement Report  
**Document Type**: Risk Control Audit Report  
**Module**: IRS (Interaction Responsiveness Score)  
**Objective**: Identify potential security vulnerabilities, propose improvements, and prevent the IRS scoring system from being misused or bypassed.

## ⚠️ Issue 1: Risk of AI-Based Fake Livestreams Evading Detection

- **Cause**:  
  AI technologies can use TTS (text-to-speech) and motion simulation to mimic real-time interactions, potentially bypassing basic responsiveness scoring.

- **Risk Level**: 🟥 High

- **Potential Impact**:  
  - Fake AI livestreams may impersonate real service providers.  
  - Undermines the credibility of the IRS system.  
  - Weakens platform trust and overall risk control effectiveness.

- **Recommended Improvements**:  
  - Add **random visual challenge mechanisms** (e.g., request to capture a random object in the camera view).  
  - Add **contextual Q&A challenges** (e.g., “What’s the name of the shop on your left?”).  
  - Add **dynamic motion instructions** (e.g., “Turn around 180° and return”).  
  - Introduce **real-time interaction verification logs** for backend risk review.  
  - 📸 **Additional Rule**:  
    > Providing **motion verification** is a mandatory service obligation for all service providers.  
    > Providers **must not refuse** the requester’s verification instructions and must **respond to voice prompts**.  
    > Refusal or non-cooperation will result in a **score reduction**, affecting future order eligibility.

## ⚠️ Issue 2: Abuse of Subjective Ratings and Score Manipulation

- **Cause**:  
  Subjective user ratings have a high weight (~20%), creating the potential for score inflation through fake orders.

- **Risk Level**: 🟧 Medium–High

- **Potential Impact**:  
  - Manipulated scores may undermine fairness and credibility.  
  - Malicious users could gain higher exposure and priority.  
  - Increases manual review workload.

- **Recommended Improvements**:  
  - Trigger manual review when the same IP gives frequent ratings to the same provider.  
  - Raise alerts when abnormal high scores occur (e.g., 10+ consecutive full scores).  
  - Implement score caps and auto-freeze mechanisms to prevent score farming.  
  - Introduce **source weighting** to differentiate genuine vs. suspicious orders.

## ⚠️ Issue 3: Lack of a Clear Disclaimer (Risk of Misinterpretation as “Credit Score”)

- **Cause**:  
  Without a clear disclaimer, users may mistakenly perceive IRS as a credit or identity verification score.

- **Risk Level**: 🟨 Medium

- **Potential Impact**:  
  - Users may misinterpret IRS as a credit or trust signal.  
  - Could lead to trust disputes or legal concerns.  
  - Creates compliance risks for the platform.

- **Recommended Improvements**:  
  - Add a **clear disclaimer** on the scoring page and help documentation:  
    > “This score only reflects the interaction quality and responsiveness of the service provider.  
    > It cannot be used to confirm their identity or personal credit.  
    > Do not rely on this score for offline trust or financial decisions.”  
  - Display the disclaimer prominently in the UI.  
  - Log the disclaimer version number for traceability and compliance audit.

## 📌 Summary

- The IRS risk control model is generally sound, but **AI circumvention** and **rating abuse** remain key vulnerabilities.  
- Adding **randomized verification mechanisms** and **abuse detection rules** will strengthen system reliability.  
- Declaring that **motion verification is a basic service obligation** creates a clear enforcement baseline.  
- A **clear disclaimer** is essential to reduce legal risk and prevent user misinterpretation.

✅ It is recommended to include these vulnerabilities in the **priority risk mitigation list** and align with the compliance team to ensure the IRS scoring system is not misused as an identity or credit rating mechanism.
