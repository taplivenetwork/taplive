| Review Item                                        | Issue Identified         | Detailed Analysis & Conclusion                                                                                   |

| 🚫 Risk of implying a “credit score”?               | No significant risk ✅    | IRS is clearly defined as “Interaction Responsiveness Score,” not a credit scoring system. No credit concept implied. |
| 🚫 Risk of being misunderstood as identity judgment?| Low risk ⚠️              | Although not explicitly stated, it is recommended to clearly declare “IRS is not a real identity verification system” to avoid user misunderstanding. |
| 🚫 Fairness for “non-camera” service providers?     | Fairness ensured ✅       | The scoring system excludes whether the user appears on camera, ensuring privacy protection and non-discrimination. |
| 🚫 Risk of score manipulation by subjective rating? | Possible risk ⚠️         | Subjective ratings can be exploited (e.g., score farming). It is recommended to monitor abnormal fluctuations in user ratings through the risk control module. |
| 🚫 Can AI-generated content bypass the scoring system?| Possible risk ⚠️       | Relying solely on voice and motion matching is insufficient. Adding randomized interactive challenges is recommended to enhance defense mechanisms. |
