# TapLive Project Pitch

TapLive aims to connect people to real-world actions through on-demand, real-time collaboration. The platform focuses on **location-based** live dispatch, **human trust**, and **decentralized interaction**.

### Why It Matters
- **Real-time collaboration** through live video orders
- **Geo-verified** trust layer to prevent fraud
- **Open-source** and **compliant** with no token or assetization

TapLive Founder’s Statement: A Non-Technical Person’s Long-Term Vision

I have always been obsessed with the idea of “connecting people to the distant world.”
The birth of TapLive was not a spur-of-the-moment impulse, but the result of years of observation and reflection. We live in an era of highly developed technology, yet we still struggle to truly “orchestrate reality” — when you are far away and want to access a specific place, gather certain information, or ask for help to complete a task, you're still helpless.
We already have social networks, payment networks, and logistics networks, but we are still missing a platform that truly connects “real-time presence”.
What I envisioned was this situation:

When someone in any corner of the world has a temporary need — they want to see a scene, understand what’s happening in a city corner, or request help for a small task in the real world...
They should be able to quickly summon another person’s “real-world presence” — just like sending a message — through live streaming, voice, and interactive collaboration, establishing a trust link between them.
This thought kept resurfacing:
What if collaboration at a distance could be as simple as text messaging? How many new possibilities would that unlock?
TapLive’s goal is to build a decentralized on-demand reality collaboration engine.
On this network, people can not only see each other but also collaborate and act — what connects them is not words or images, but the immediacy of action.

I am not a computer science professional, and my previous exposure to basic technologies like HTML and Linux was out of personal interest and for small projects. These experiences didn’t equip me with the ability to develop TapLive, but they did help me realize early on that building a technological system is not something that can be accomplished with passion or by one person alone — it requires long-term collaboration, shared understanding, and genuine consensus.
The concept of TapLive originated more than a decade ago. At that time, I had no knowledge of decentralization. I often wondered: Is there a way to summon someone from afar to accomplish something in the real world?
For a long time, this idea remained in the form of notes and sketches. Over the years, I tried to push it forward — showing it to friends, discussing it with others, seeking potential paths to realization. I did find some people who agreed with the direction, but without a prototype or team, it was hard to bring this idea to life. It remained in the form of sketches, documents, and fragmented notes, waiting for a more mature opportunity.
It wasn’t until recent years, when I started to explore Web3, blockchain, and DAO governance concepts, that I realized: Perhaps these kinds of systems can no longer follow the traditional platform logic, but should be built as an open, autonomous, and evolving collaborative network.
Thus, TapLive today is no longer just a product concept — it’s an experiment on how humanity can collaboratively build a real-time action network.

So, this is an invitation letter.

To all developers, collaborators, and idealists who are looking for direction:
If you can feel the future that this concept points toward — a platform that transcends geographical boundaries and orchestrates human actions in the real world; a new network that connects people, trust, collaboration, and remote presence; a system driven by consensus rather than by any one company, please consider joining us.
We cannot promise that TapLive will succeed, but we always believe:

Some things are worth trying; some scenes must be seen;
Some connections may be waiting for us to create together.
May we, before we even meet in person,
Already be on the road to creating the future together.
