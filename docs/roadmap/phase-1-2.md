# Roadmap — Phase 1–2 (Public)

## Objectives
- MVP: on-demand livestream order → accept → deliver → minimal replay access controls.
- Public webhooks and SDK samples.
- Basic LBS and ethical flags (principle-level).

## Milestones (Illustrative)
- **M0 — Repo Public Docs**: P0 docs, webhook sample, replay SDK examples.
- **M1 — MVP Demo**: Minimal order flow + replay availability event.
- **M2 — Hardening**: Rate limits, error model, basic abuse guardrails.
- **M3 — Phase 2 GIS (Public)**: Aggregated geohints, privacy notes, public API surfaces.

> Phase 3+ materials remain internal-only until community decides otherwise.
