# TapLive Project DAO Governance Boundary Statement

To ensure the decentralized nature of the TapLive project and clarify the founder's legitimate rights and responsibilities, the following statement is made:

1. **The project is currently initiated anonymously and has no token plans**. No form of blockchain token or financial instrument will be issued, designed, or circulated.
   
2. **DAO governance will be initiated and voted on by community members**. Any future content involving economic models, incentive systems, or token issuance, if applicable, must go through an independent proposal process and does not represent the founderâ€™s will or authorization.
   
3. **The project founder will not participate in voting, fund control, token design, private sale allocation, etc.** The founder's responsibilities are limited to platform concept development, infrastructure opening, and community organization.
   
4. **All governance-related actions should be executed by the DAO community through on-chain governance systems**. The project founder will not be held responsible for any actions taken by the DAO.
   
5. All project documents, code repositories, and proposal history will be stored on public platforms (such as GitHub, Notion) for traceability and auditing.

ðŸ“Œ This statement applies to all current and future documents, code repositories, frontend pages, and platform interactions of the TapLive project, unless explicitly amended through DAO voting.
