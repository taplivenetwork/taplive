# Risk Control Basics

At TapLive, we prioritize the safety, trust, and integrity of the platform. Below are the key risk control mechanisms in place to ensure a secure environment for both users and developers:

## Geo-Location Verification
- Every live order is linked to a **real-time geo-location** of the requester and the service provider.
- Users can verify their location before placing or accepting an order, preventing fraud and ensuring trustworthiness.

## Trust Layer
- **Reputation scoring** will be implemented to evaluate the trustworthiness of service providers and customers.
- Users can rate each other after completing an interaction, contributing to the platform's overall trust system.

## Secure Communication Channels
- All communication between users (video, chat, etc.) is secured using **end-to-end encryption**.
- No personal data is shared with third parties unless explicitly required by law or for platform improvements.

## Future Enhancements
- **Automated fraud detection** mechanisms will be developed to identify suspicious activities.
- We are exploring the implementation of AI-based fraud protection systems for better prevention.

If you identify any security risks, have suggestions for improvements, or want to report an issue, please feel free to:
