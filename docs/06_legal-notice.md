# Legal Notice

## Compliance

TapLive is committed to full legal compliance, and we do not issue or trade any financial assets or tokens.  
The platform uses TapLive Credits as a non-financial system to track user engagement,contributions and reputation.

This commitment does not prohibit TapLive from supporting lawful payment methods in the future.  
Subject to compliance and licensing requirements, the platform may enable payments using fiat currencies, stablecoins, or widely recognized cryptocurrencies (such as BTC, ETH, USDT and so on) purely as payment toolsâ€”not as investment products or platform-issued tokens.

## Non-Financial System
TapLive Credits cannot be converted into cash, exchanged for goods or services outside the platform, or considered investment instruments. Participation in TapLive does **not** require any financial investment or imply any expectation of profit.

## Future Considerations
TapLive has no current plans to issue tokens or other digital assets. If, at any future point, the independent community proposes mechanisms involving tokenization, digital assets, or financial transactions:

- Proposals must undergo a **transparent community governance process**;
- Full **legal review and regulatory compliance** must be completed before any implementation;
- Participation will remain **voluntary and non-investment-based**.

Until such mechanisms are approved, **TapLive does not offer or imply any financial products, assets, or token issuance**, and there should be no assumption of future profit beyond normal platform order transactions.

## Acknowledgment
By using TapLive, users acknowledge that the platform is **not conducting token sales, investments, or financial offerings**, and that all TapLive Credits are internal, non-financial markers of activity and reputation.


# TapLive DAO Governance Boundary Statement

To ensure TapLive remains decentralized and clarify founder responsibilities:

1. **Anonymous Founding and No Token Plans**  
   TapLive was initially created anonymously. **No blockchain tokens or financial instruments** will be issued, designed, or circulated by the founder.

2. **Community-Driven Governance**  
   All DAO governance decisions, including any future proposals regarding incentives, digital assets, or token issuance, must be approved **solely through community voting**. No proposal represents the founderâ€™s personal authorization.

3. **Founderâ€™s Limited Role**  
   The founderâ€™s responsibilities are limited to platform conceptualization, technical infrastructure preparation, and community organization. The founder will **not participate in voting, fund management, token design, or allocation**.

4. **DAO Accountability**  
   Governance actions and their consequences rest entirely with the DAO. The founder is not responsible for any DAO decisions.

5. **Transparency and Traceability**  
   All project documents, code repositories, and proposals will be publicly archived (e.g., GitHub, Notion) to ensure **full traceability and auditing**.

ðŸ“Œ This statement applies to all TapLive documents, code, frontend pages, and platform interactions unless explicitly amended through DAO voting.


# Compliance and Liability Disclaimer

## 1. Risk Awareness
TapLive is a platform connecting users with **independent service providers (gig workers)** who may travel to perform live-streamed tasks. While TapLive **strives to implement safety, risk prevention, and security measures**, including identity verification, safety guidance, real-time monitoring, and order-level insurance options, all participants **accept inherent risks** such as:

- Commuting and traffic incidents;
- Health emergencies during task execution;
- Fraudulent activity or financial loss;
- Technical failures or platform disruptions.

## 2. Limited Liability
TapLive and its founders **exercise reasonable care** but do **not assume responsibility for extraordinary, unforeseen, or unavoidable events** beyond the platformâ€™s control. Users and service providers participate voluntarily and are encouraged to take personal precautions, including using optional platform-provided insurance for each order.

## 3. Insurance Options
TapLive may offer **embedded, pay-per-task insurance** via third-party providers to cover accidents, health emergencies, or third-party liabilities. Participation in insurance is **optional**, but recommended to mitigate risks.

## 4. Terms of Participation
By using TapLive, users acknowledge:

- TapLive **cannot guarantee complete risk elimination**;
- Users should **assess and accept risks** associated with platform activities;
- TapLive **will implement reasonable risk control measures**, monitor tasks, and provide guidance, but extraordinary losses may still occur;
- TapLive reserves the right to **adjust risk mitigation and insurance options** as the platform evolves.

This approach ensures the platform conveys a **responsible, user-protective stance** without implying full exemption from legal obligations.
