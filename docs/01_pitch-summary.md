**# 🪄 TapLive Project Pitch**

- ***Last updated:**** 2025-10-11

**## 🌍 Vision**

Connect people to real-world actions through ****on-demand, location-based livestreaming****.

Anyone, anywhere, can order a real-time livestream from a local person — and experience the world remotely, instantly.

**## ❌ Problem**

- Hard to ***verify real-time reality**** remotely.
- Livestreaming is often ***broadcast-only****, not collaborative.
- No open infrastructure for ***on-demand human presence****.

**## ✅ Solution**

- ***On-demand live dispatch**** at any location.
- ***LBS-based matching**** between requesters and local service providers.
- ***Replay & trust layer**** with geolocation checks.
- ***Open modules**** for developers to extend.

**## 🧭 Use Cases**

Tourism & exploration • Live event access • Remote check-in • Research/field work • Local errands

**## 🧑‍💻 Early Tech Stack**

Frontend: WebRTC (React/Flutter) • Backend: Node.js + Express + GraphQL • Infra: LBS Dispatch + Replay Viewer • Security: Anti-fraud + Geo Trust Layer

**## 🚀 Why It Matters**

TapLive aims to build a ****real-time collaboration layer for the physical world****.
