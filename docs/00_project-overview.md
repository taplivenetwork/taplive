# 🔹 What is TapLive?

**TapLive is a decentralized, location-based, video-on-demand collaboration network.**
Users can initiate a livestream request, "Please film this place," from anywhere in the world at any time. Real people in the field can respond and accept the request, completing the livestream, collaboration, and recording and uploading the video, ultimately creating a trusted, real-time record that can be shared.
We are committed to making livestreaming no longer exclusive to influencers, but a tool for real-world collaboration and information sharing. TapLive is not a content platform, but a trusted, collaborative infrastructure that connects people and places.

# TapLive Project Origin: A Non-Technical Person’s Long-Term Vision

The initial idea for TapLive didn’t come from a moment of sudden inspiration, but from repeated experiences of information asymmetry: When I wanted to see what was happening in a certain place, feel the temperature, humidity, crowd, and atmosphere of a corner, I could only rely on delayed snippets, blurry short videos, or even deliberately edited content on social media platforms.

I once thought: What if there was a way to "order the reality of a place at this moment" as easily as ordering a cup of coffee?

Thus, an idea gradually took shape: Allow people to “order a scene in the real world” and have the nearest person respond to that request via a live broadcast. This action might sound like task distribution, but it’s more like a collaborative perception between people, a way of "lending your eyes to someone else."

TapLive is not designed for commercial hype, nor is it meant to imitate any existing project. It originates from a genuine unmet need, attempting to use a decentralized approach to address details that are difficult to capture in a “too centralized world.”

In the initial architecture of TapLive, I envisioned the following core principles:

LBS-driven Order System: Every order request is a “perception demand” for a specific coordinate in reality. The platform does not distribute content, it distributes “desires.”

Anyone Can Be a Responder: No need for professional streaming equipment, as long as you're there and willing to respond, you can take the order.

Orders as Value Anchors: The fundamental unit of the platform is not content, but orders. All incentives and revenue are centered around orders.

Distributed Caching and Decentralized Storage: Recorded videos are not stored for the platform but are intended to respond to similar future orders, enabling delayed gratification.

Trustless Verification Mechanism: LBS verification, interactive validation, community rating, and other mechanisms are employed to prevent fraudulent behavior and maintain the “reality” of the system.

As I pieced these ideas together, I realized: TapLive is not just a live-streaming platform; it’s more like an “operating layer protocol” for the real world, a “social API” that can be repeatedly called, reconstructed, and combined.

I’m fully aware that I may not be the best developer for this, but I believe I might be the one who can feel the temperature of this direction the earliest. So, I decided to submit this idea to hackathons and release it in communities, to find those who are better at technology and implementation than me.

TapLive is a starting point, an attempt at a new type of network service.

I don’t know where it will ultimately lead, and I’m not sure if it will succeed, But I am willing to give it a sincere try with my enthusiasm.

TapLive is not just a platform; it’s a redefinition of “human collaboration boundaries.”
