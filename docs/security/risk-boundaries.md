# Ethical Boundaries & Risk Positioning (Public)

- Service intent: facilitate real-world collaboration and trust building; no assetization or financial expectations.
- We prohibit abuse, harassment, illegal surveillance, and privacy violations.
- Public docs describe **principles** only; internal thresholds/weights are not disclosed.
- Replay access control: minimum viable checks, auditable change logs, and opt-in visibility controls.
